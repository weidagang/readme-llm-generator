# --- Shell Scripts ---
# Define paths to the scripts for easier maintenance
BUILD_SCRIPT := ./scripts/create-image.sh
RUN_SCRIPT   := ./scripts/generate-readme-llm.sh

# --- Commands ---
# .PHONY declares targets that are not actual files.
.PHONY: help setup build run clean

# The default command executed when you just type 'make'.
